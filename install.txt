a. How to install any dependencies your software requires.
    1. Install SFML for linux https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php (I developed the game on WSL)
    2. Run the command “make all” for compiling the binaries  and "make test" to make the test

b. How to compile your code with g++ (include the exact terminal command,
not an IDE configuration).
    1. The code is in the makefile and can be compiled using the makefile 

c. How to run your code, including a brief description of what should happen
when we run your code (e.g., should a GUI window open?) will it spend
more than a few minutes processing data?
    1. Run ./tetris.exe 
    2. You will be prompted to a menu welcoming you to TETRIS_CPP 
    3. You will then be prompted to select your difficulty (whether easy, medium, or hard) 
    4. (You will be prompted again if not e,m, or h) 
    5. The game window will open and you can move your piece left, right, down, or placed down (space bar),
       as well as rotate (using the up arrow key) 
    6. Once your pile reaches to the top, the game will be over and you will be told your score and the lines cleared



ALL screenshots and the video are in this folder, watch the video without volume (it has random noise): It shows lines being cleared
